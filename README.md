# Pizzaria-Mamma-Mia

This is a project that I did during my internship with Celonis Business Analyst, in this project, I used the Celonis analysis platform to analyze the business of a pizza shop. I understand where the process of the shop is going wrong with process mining and we try to suggest some new ideas or correct the existing ones. The goal is plain and simple improve the business when they consult you. This is my first time doing this kind of field and very much interested in this field and I wish to continue down the path. Feel free to correct my mistakes.
