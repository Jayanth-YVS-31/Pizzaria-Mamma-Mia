# Pizzaria-Mamma-Mia

This is a project that I did during my virtual internship with Celonis as a Business Analyst, in this project, I used the Celonis analysis platform to analyze the business of a pizza shop. I understand where the process of the shop is going wrong with process mining and we try to suggest some new ideas or correct the existing ones. The goal is plain and simple improve the business when they consult you. This is my first time doing this kind of field and very much interested in this field and I wish to continue down the path. Feel free to correct my mistakes.

The screenshots that I uploaded are from my Celonis studio. My initial views which I wrote are in the picture 'first_views'.

The suggestions that I recommend are:
* Need to reduce some pizza baking time, also carefully take the orders to reduce the chance for rebaking of pizza.
* Routing methods and delivery time should be taken care of.
* Customer payment method for delivery pizzas should be relooked.
* Orders taken from the website should be approved fast.

  There may be many ways to improve, but we need to follow the Paleto principle and focus on the 20% problems that cause 80% of headaches.
